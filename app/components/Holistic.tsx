          Mastermind is committed to the quality care of women and children, and
          we want to see other women and children experience positive
          self-growth in all areas of life. Although Mastermind is faith based,
          we do offer a purely secular track for all other services excluding
          spiritual. Spiritual services are there for those who choose to use
          them, but they are not a requirement to be approved for our women and
          childrenâ€™s transitional housing.
